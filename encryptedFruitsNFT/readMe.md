# Encrypted Fruit NFT Minting

My first NFT project deployed on the Scroll Sepolia testnet. 
I encrypted a set of fruit images, uploaded them to IPFS using Pinata, and minted each as a unique NFT on Ethereum. 
This project explores secure asset storage through encryption, decentralized file hosting, and NFT tokenization.
